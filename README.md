## Overview

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a flexible and powerful tool for managing disk storage on Linux systems. It allows for dynamic allocation, resizing, and management of disk partitions (logical volumes), making it easier to adapt to changing storage needs.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: Increase or decrease the size of logical volumes on-the-fly.
- **Snapshots**: Create point-in-time copies of volumes for backups or testing.
- **Striping and Mirroring**: Improve performance and reliability by distributing data across multiple physical disks.
- **Volume Groups**: Manage multiple logical volumes under a single volume group for efficient storage management.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Compatible with most Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch).
- **Disk Space**: At least one physical disk or partition to initialize as a physical volume (PV).

## Installation

LVM is often included with Linux distributions. You can install it using your distribution's package manager:

### For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lvm2
